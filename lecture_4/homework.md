# Refactor
* Apply feedback for previous homeworks, get ready for new functionality

# react-redux containers
* Create two different containers, one for new game buttons and one for ongoing games
* Containers must be created using `connect` from react-redux
* Use created containers in root (App) container
* Only current input state is allowed to be in React, all other state management must be moved to Redux

# Actions
* Actions must contain only plain JavaScript objects
* Action names must describe what happened, not what to do

# Reducers
* All reducers must be pure functions
* All reducer code paths must be tested

# Redux dev tools
