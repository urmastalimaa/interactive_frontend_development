# Lecture 4

Lecture 4 introduces a unidirectional way of managing state in applications
(either front-end or back-end): [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

The examples borrow heavily from [Redux official guides](http://redux.js.org/).

## Study goals

* What is state? What is a value?
* Why is it good to have all application state in one object?
* How to pass state and callbacks to React components without having it all in the root React component.
* Flux / Elm / Redux application architecture
* Actions, reducers
* Reducer composition
