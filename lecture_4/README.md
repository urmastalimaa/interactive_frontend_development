# State and Redux

This lecture we will put a big focus on [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). It is a great library for handling state in front-end application which works great with React.

The examples borrow heavily from [Redux official guides](http://redux.js.org/).

The comment list example builds on top of [React official guide](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)
