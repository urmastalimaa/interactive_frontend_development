# Interactive frontend development
An University of Tartu seminar about front-end development with JavaScript.

Course page with slides and Video seminars can be found [here](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/2017/react/spring/)

This repository hold study goals, homework requirements and example code.

## Concepts and techniques
The course will concentrate on declarative programming and extensive testing.

### Building
Webpack, babel and eslint are used to build JavaScript source code.

### View layer
[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is used for declarative views.
The library is mostly used in its most basic form and could be replaced by any declarative view library.

### State management
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is used to manage state.
The library is declarative and very simple.

## End result
At the end of the course, students should feel comfortable about working with
JavaScript front-end projects in teams of any size. Students should be able to
build and test a medium sized JavaScript application on their own.
