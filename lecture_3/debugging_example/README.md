# Browserify example

To use:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Open the console in your browser, you should see a breakpoint on `debugger`

## Explanation

Sourcemaps map the bundle.js back to the bundled files. This allows us to see the code in Robot.js.
We can also set breakpoints by clicking on line numbers on the left.
