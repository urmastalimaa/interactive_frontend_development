# Lecture 5

Asynchronous processes in user interface design.

## Study goals
* What are the states of an asynchronous process?
* How to use asynchronous actions with Redux?
* What are Redux middlewares?
* How to separate user interactions from requests to a server?

The examples borrow heavily from [Redux official guides](http://redux.js.org/).
