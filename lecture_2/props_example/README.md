# Props example

To use:
```
npm install && npm run start
```

## Explanation

index.js has 4 React components.
Check comments on those Components for further explanation.

## Props and rendering
Note that all _props_ are immutable. Whenever something needs to change, a whole new render cycle with new _props_ objects is performed.
