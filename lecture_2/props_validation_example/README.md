# Props validation example

To use:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Open console

## Explanation

The propTypes checks that the props that are passed from the parent always are of correct type. The isRequired means that if the property value is missing, an error is thrown.

These checks are only made in development mode and you can check them out if you open the console.
