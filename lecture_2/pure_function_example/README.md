### Pure function components

`Comment`, `CommentList` and `CommentForm` are implemented as _pure function
components_. A pure function component receives _props_ as an argument and must
return a React node (JSX).

### Prop validation

All components were added prop validations.
Presence of prop validation is checked by eslint.
