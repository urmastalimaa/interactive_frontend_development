# Webpack example

## Running the application

```
npm install
npm run build
open index.html
```

#### Expected behaviour

* A title in the center of a greenish background is seen on the page
* "I'm a robot" is logged to JavaScript console

## Explanation

`npm install`
npm install installs all the package dependencies

`npm run build` points to a script in `package.json` which runs `webpack`.

`webpack` generates a JavaScript file (dist/bundle.js) using the specified configuration file (webpack.config.js). Babel is configured (in .babelrc) to transpile JavaScript files to be parseable by the target browsers.

Compare the distribution file generated by `npm build` with the files in src/. Try running `npm build` with different browser targets and see how the distribution file changes.
