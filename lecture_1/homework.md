# Homework 1

## Configure initial project and specify dependencies

* Create *index.html* 
  * Must include one JavaScript file (e.g /dist/bundle.js) and one CSS file (e.g /styles/app.css) in document *head*
  * The JavaScript file must be executed after *DOM* has loaded
  * Set a *title* to the document
* Counter button
  * Create a button using `Document.createElement` which displays "Clicked n times" in index.js (starting from n=0).
  * Define a class 'Counter' with methods *increase* and *getCount* in a separate file.
  * Add at least 2 unit tests for Counter
  * Create an instance of 'Counter' in index.js and use it to count how many times button is clicked.
  * Align button to horizontal center using **flexbox**
* Use *webpack 2* as a module bundler and development server
  * Configure webpack to output one JS file (e.g ./dist/bundle.js)
  * Configure webpack to use babel as a transpiler for JavaScript files
  * Configure webpack to include source maps in the JavaScript bundle
* Configure babel to output JavaScript that is
  * compatible with browsers with *equal to or more than 3% market share*
* Configure eslint
  * Configure to work with babel (_babel-eslint_)
  * Set "browser" as target environment
  * Use eslint and/or google recommended rules
  * Validate imports (_eslint-plugin-import_)
  * Lint your tests! (You can have a different _eslint_ configuration for _test/_ folder)
* Use mocha as a test runner
* Use chai as an assertion library
* Specify ALL your dependencies in *package.json* (use devDependencies for dependencies which are only used for building/testing)
* `npm install && npm start` must serve your application on `localhost:8080` (and optionally open the default web browser on that page)
* `npm install && npm test` must lint your source files and run unit tests
* When localhost:8080 is open and any source file (not build configuration) is changed, the page should reload automatically.

## Style and submission

* For your own sanity, use a version control system (learn if you have to!).
* **Don't** leave this to the last minute (really!)
* **Don't** include node_modules/ nor any other autogenerated files in your submission (also exclude them from source control)
* Make sure you have no JavaScript linting errors or warnings.
* Use CamelCase for variable, file and class naming (except CSS selectors).
* zip your files together (**don't include node_modules/ or .git/ or .hg/!**) and submit the zip file on the course page

## Sanity check

* Delete node_modules/ and dist/ directories
* Run `npm install && npm test` and check that your tests pass
* Run `npm start` and check that your application works as expected
